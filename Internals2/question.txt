Design a pyspark application to monitor real-time data from weather sensors. 
App should include data producer and analysis modules. 
Data need to be generated are placeName, date and time, temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation.
Generate alarms if temperature crosses 45C or wind speed is more than 30kmph. Need to capture atleast for 5 cities.
